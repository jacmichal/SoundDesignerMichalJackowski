Sound Designer Assesment by Michal Jackowski
Hi, 
I would like to thank you for this opportunity to learn some new things. I was really having fun doing all that, even if I'm Unity total begginer :)
Have a good time watchinig this mini-game with my sounds. Sound effects are from the sounds library, but the music is mine originally.
Best regards,
Michal
